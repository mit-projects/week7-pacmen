# Pac Men Project

Create Pac Man-like critters in random locations and set them in motion (with initial random velocity and direction). Watch them bounce around the page! **Then murder them with your mouse pointer.**

Download the files, drag index.html onto a browser and use.
Or just use the [live version here.](https://mit-projects.github.io/week7-pacmen/)

# Road Map

- Making it mobile friendly (especially iPad)
- Randomize creation of pac men rather than controlled by a button.
- scoring system?
